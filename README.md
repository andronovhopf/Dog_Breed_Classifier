# Dog Breed Classifier

This code is for the example given in [Start Version Controlling your ML Datasets](link when live).

## Step 1
Run get_dog_dataset.sh to download the Stanford Dog Dataset and make a new data directory containing a subset of the images for a classification problem (100 Afghan Hound images and 100 Maltese images). 

## Step 2
The script breed_classifier.py contains the classifier model. It has been tested with Tensorflow 1.14.0 and Keras 2.3.0. 

## Step 3
To experiment with changing the dataset, try running grow_dog_dataset.sh to add another 100 images of each breed.
